                analysis or upon request of relevant authorities.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Ownership and control</strong>: You own and control your private key(s) and
                are solely
                responsible for safeguarding them. We are not responsible for any loss or theft of
                your
                private key(s) or any funds stored in your wallet.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Risks</strong>: You understand and acknowledge that DeFi protocols and
                associated smart
                contracts are subject to inherent risks and that you use Dollet Wallet at your own
                risk.

                suitable
                for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.</p>
              <p>You also acknowledge that Dollet is not liable for the defamatory, offensive, or
                illegal conduct of other users, and that you alone are assuming the risk of injury
                from the foregoing, to the fullest extent of the law. In no event will Dollet, its
                affiliates, any of their advisers, directors, contractors, or licensors or any other
                person or entity involved in creating, producing or providing the services, be
                liable
                for any damages, including, without limitation, direct, indirect, incidental,
                special,
                consequential or punitive damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the
                services. In addition to these Terms, neither Dollet, nor its affiliates, agents,
                advisers, information providers, content partners, or third-party providers, shall
                be

                or other defects in, or untimeliness or unauthenticity of, the information contained
                within the services, or for any delay or interruption in the transmission thereof to
                you, or for any claims or losses arising therefrom or occasioned thereby.</p>
              <p>Dollet shall not be liable for any third-party claims or losses of any nature,
                including, but not limited to, lost profits, punitive or consequential damages.</p>

              <p><strong>No investment advice</strong>: We do not provide investment advice, and you

                are solely responsible for making your own investment decisions.</p></li>

              <p><strong>Prohibited activities</strong>: You may not use Dollet Wallet for any
                illegal, fraudulent,
                or otherwise prohibited activities. In case if the team of Dollet Wallet learns
                about
                illegal nature of activities for which our Service is used, we reserve the right to
                refuse you in further provision of the Service. The list of such prohibited
                activities
                includes but is not limited to: unlawful activity, fraud, intellectual property

            <li>
              <p><strong>Third-party links and content</strong>: We are not responsible for any
                third-party links or
                content that may be accessed through Dollet Wallet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Non-custodial service</strong>. Dollet does not provide any custodial
                services – the wallet is
                decentralized, and we have no ability to control your wallet, funds or private keys.
                Any services that have a custodial nature that may be made available to you in the
                Dollet Wallet applications will be provided only by licensed and regulated
                third-party
                providers. In such a case, you will need to agree tothe separate terms of use of
                these
                third-party providers and undergo all AML/KYC procedures required for such actions
                (currency exchange, crypto to fiat exchanges etc.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>DeFi Strategies</strong>. The proposed DeFi strategies that from time to
                time
                may be made
                available to You in the Dollet Wallet applications are the sequence of preliminarily
                programmed actions that does not change from user to user and cannot be changed once
                posted, but can be made unavailable for new interactions at some point. DeFi
                strategies are the instrument for the users to place their funds into the
                third-party
                staking pools and get profits. We may charge some percent out of the profits made by
                you within the respective DeFi strategies to be able to maintain the decentralized
                service operational. We do not have any access to your funds and cannot change the
                smart contract once the strategy is posted in the application – all actions are
                preliminarily automated and are utilized on a machine level.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Storage of Private Key</strong>: A private key in a decentralized mobile
                crypto wallet is
                stored locally on the user's device.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Encryption</strong>: The private key is encrypted with a PIN that only the
                user would know.
                This means that even if someone could access the file containing the private key,
                they
                wouldn't be able to use it without also knowing the user's password or other
                authentication details.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Backup and Recovery</strong>: The user will also provide a recovery phrase
                (12 or 24 words)
                during the setup process. This phrase is a human-readable representation of the
                private key and can be used to recover the wallet if the device is lost or the
                password is forgotten. It's crucial to keep this phrase safe and private, as anyone
                with access to it can control the funds in your wallet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer of warranties</strong>: Dollet Wallet is provided on an "as is"

                for

                subject matter covered by these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be
                void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full

                subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents (which term includes but is not limited to

                have
                the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf.</p>

                government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the
                objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law

                and effect.</p>

                The highest level of security at Weld Money is achieved by
                implementing several state-of-the-art measures. This includes
                2-factor authentication, the use of the HTTP TLS 1.2+ protocol
                for maximum protection of data transmission over the Internet,
                and, of course, constant Penetration tests from our partners.
                In addition, we use state-of-the-art key encryption
                algorithms, cryptography, Disaster Recovery Flow, and
